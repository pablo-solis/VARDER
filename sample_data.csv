You seem to have inferred that spreads have widened more than is warranted by the return on those",0.872,0.8176,0.128,0.0,75

I am saying that the spreads have widened a lot relative to the actual experience, given that we are in a period of weaker economic growth.  The stress seems to be more on the spreads that the ",0.787,0.0,0.113,0.1,79
